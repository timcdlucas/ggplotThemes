# ggplot2 themes

I will use this repo to collect themes.
I intend to write at least a basic theme and a presentation theme.

I will probably also write a theme to use in my nicely typesetted thesis as well as perhaps a poster theme and a blogpost theme.



## Base theme

```{r data, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide', message = FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
library(grid)

d <- data.frame(a = 1:10, b = rpois(10, 4), c = rep(c('a', 'b'), 5))
source('theme_tcdl.R')

set.seed(10000)

```


```{r baseTheme, dev = 'png', fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(d, aes(x = a, y = b, fill = c)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position=position_dodge()) +
  xlab('The X axis') + 
  ylab('The Y axis') +
  theme_tcdl



ggplot(d, aes(x = a, y = b)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3.5) +
  xlab('The X axis') + 
  ylab('The Y axis') +
  theme_tcdl


```
