# ggplot2 themes

I will use this repo to collect themes.
I intend to write at least a basic theme and a presentation theme.

I will probably also write a theme to use in my nicely typesetted thesis as well as perhaps a poster theme and a blogpost theme.



## Base theme




<img src="figure/baseTheme-1.png" title="plot of chunk baseTheme" alt="plot of chunk baseTheme" width="0.8\textwidth" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /><img src="figure/baseTheme-2.png" title="plot of chunk baseTheme" alt="plot of chunk baseTheme" width="0.8\textwidth" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
